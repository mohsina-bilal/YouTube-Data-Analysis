# YouTube Comment Sentiment Analysis

A project for sentiment analysis of YouTube comments using machine learning techniques.

## Description

This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on YouTube comments to understand the overall sentiment and opinions expressed by viewers. Sentiment analysis involves classifying text data into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment categories.

The provided Colab notebook demonstrates the following steps for performing sentiment analysis:

1. Data Collection: The project utilizes the YouTube Data API to fetch comments from specific YouTube videos. The comments are retrieved in text format for further analysis.

2. Data Preprocessing: The text comments are preprocessed to remove noise, such as special characters, URLs, or emojis. Tokenization and cleaning techniques are applied to convert the comments into a suitable format for analysis.

3. Sentiment Analysis: The preprocessed comments are fed into a machine learning model to predict the sentiment of each comment. The model can be based on various techniques such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).

4. Visualization: The project provides visualizations to present insights from the sentiment analysis, such as sentiment distribution, word clouds, or sentiment trends over time.
